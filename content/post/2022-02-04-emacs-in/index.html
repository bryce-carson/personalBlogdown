<h1>Using a free implementation of <code>vi</code> is but a penance: or I should use <kbd>SPC</kbd> more</h1>
<p>This is the first attempt I have made to create a post from Emacs and also to
understand how blogdown actually works. The other first two posts I created, one
which was a garbage test post, and the other my first actual post, were made in
RStudio. Sinful!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open Emacs (<code>emacsclient</code>)</li>
<li><kbd>Meta</kbd><kbd>x</kbd> <code>R</code></li>
<li>Load <code>blogdown</code> and <code>tidyverse</code> (even though I’m not doing any actual R work, so I didn’t need to load the tidyverse. It’s just habit)</li>
<li><code>{r}new_post(title="Emacs-in")</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I observe that without further arguments, the default format is markdown. I rename the file to make it an RMarkdown file:</p>
<p><kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd>
<kbd>C-b</kbd> <kbd>C-b</kbd>
<code>R</code>
<kbd>Enter</kbd></p>

<div id="writing-assistive-functions-in-emacs-lisp" class="section level1">
<h1>Writing assistive functions in Emacs LISP</h1>
<p>I would like to create a modified form of <code>evil-surround</code> so that I can easily
surround some keyboard key text with the HTML <code>kbd</code> tag. I can bind this to a
key, in some map (probably only <code>ess-r-mode-map</code>), or I might look into function
advice and create some template text.</p>
<p>For instance, rather than binding it to a key of its own, I might extend
<code>evil-surround</code> such that when a work is surrounded by KBD, like <code>kbdM-xkbd</code> the
surrounding tag is converted to the actual HTML: <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/kbd&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Both would be fine.</p>
<p>I’d prefer to use
<a href="http://www.miragecraft.com/projects/keymason.html">KeyMason</a>’s wonderful CSS
and JavaScript to supersede the CSS I got from Mozilla Developer Network (MDN is
indispensible when you’re learning anything related to the web; the writing is
excellent). KeyMason shows individual keys very nicely.</p>
<p>When including this typographic flair, how should key combinations be displayed?
I think displaying it like a word, where each key is not separated by a space,
is preferrable to using some additive syntax:</p>
<p>
<kbd>Shift</kbd><span class="math inline">\(+\)</span><kbd>I</kbd>
</p>
<p>
<kbd>a</kbd><kbd>m</kbd>
</p>
<p>
<kbd>n</kbd><kbd>o</kbd><kbd>t</kbd>
</p>
<p>
<kbd>a</kbd>
</p>
<p>
<kbd>n</kbd><kbd>u</kbd><kbd>m</kbd><kbd>b</kbd><kbd>e</kbd><kbd>r</kbd>
</p>
<p>The above is an anti-example. There are also already conventions for displaying
things that should be entered by keyboard: <code>like this</code>. Longer key sequences,
regular prose, should <em>never</em> be represented as keyboard keys. What should be
represented as key sequences are command sequences, such as</p>
<p>
<kbd>g</kbd> <kbd>w</kbd>
</p>
<p>to summon <code>evil-fill</code> (which wraps text to the <code>fill-column</code> variable width of
characters per line).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>fill-column</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>/Documentation:/ Column beyond which automatic line-wrapping should happen. It
is used by filling commands, such as <code>fill-region' and</code>fill-paragraph’, and
by <code>auto-fill-mode', which see. See also</code>current-fill-column’. Interactively,
you can set the buffer local value using C-x f.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least for my own purposes, creating a style guide for writing about key
sequences and adopting a more explicit visual style for keyboard keys will help
me discuss things like what button I have defined in KMonad or some sequence of
keys that I press to run a command to get my work done when I am writing
educational content.</p>

<h1>How blogdown (sort of) works</h1>
<p>When <code>blogdown::new_post()</code> is run, at least in Emacs running as a daemon, the
iESS buffer will be occupied by the function’s execution until you are done
editing that post. When you <em>are</em> done editing, you should use <kbd>C-x</kbd>
<kbd>#</kbd> to finish editing the post with Emacs <code>server-edit</code>. You might miss
that you are supposed to do this if you are not looking at the echo area or the
messages buffer when you run create a new post with this function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; new_post(title=&quot;Emacs-in&quot;)
Waiting for Emacs...
[1] &quot;/home/garbagecollectorgnk/code/personalBlogdown/content/post/2022-02-04-emacs-in/index.md&quot;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><code>describe-function</code> (<code>C-h f</code> or <code>SPC H d f</code>): <code>server-edit</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Switch to next server editing buffer; say “Done” for current buffer. If a
server buffer is current, it is marked “done” and optionally saved. The buffer
is also killed if it did not exist before the clients asked for it. When all
of a client’s buffers are marked as “done”, the client is notified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><kbd>C-x</kbd> <kbd>#</kbd></p>
<p>This is necessary when you’re using Emacs as a daemon because
<code>blogdown::new_post()</code> calls a private function, <code>blogdown:::open_file(file, open)</code> where <code>file</code> is a YAML-good filename made from the title of the post if a
file is not specified. <code>open_file</code> falls back to <code>base::edit.file()</code> using
<code>tryCatch</code> if you’re not using RStudio (the call to <code>rstudioapi::navigateToFile</code>
will fail), and <code>edit.file</code> simply uses the <code>$EDITOR</code> environment variable,
which in my case will be emacsclient.</p>
<p>The next thing <code>blogdown::new_post()</code> appears to do is some background work to
create the directory for the new post in <code>./content/post/</code>; I didn’t read
<code>blogdown:::new_content()</code> very closely, after reading the terse new post
function I didn’t feel like it, but that’s probably where the calls to this
occur becaus they aren’t in new post.</p>
<div id="uploading" class="section level2">
<h2>Uploading</h2>
<p>To upload the new post to our Hugo website using Netlify (if you’re using these) we <em>may</em> need to knit our document. We may need to do so at least if we’re using RMarkdown, aren’t pushing that to the repository, or haven’t changed the default extension from <code>.md</code> to <code>.Rmd</code> like <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2021/05/blogdown-knit-save/#4-consistent-behavior-with-md-posts">Yihui hints</a> is common to do but unnecessary if you’re not even evaluating any R code (if you’re always using <code>eval=FALSE}</code>).</p>
<p>Perhaps I made the wrong decision to blindly choose Rmd as well…</p>
<p>Anyways, using <code>blogdown::build_site()</code>, <code>check_site()</code>, and <code>rmarkdown::knitr()</code> we get our HTML and then run <code>check_site()</code> again. No errors, no warnings, no TODOs. Commit (no sin by) using Magit, push to remote.origin with SSH and we should see the post become live on the Netlify site in a just a moment!</p>
<p>I do recommend setting up SSH keys. They make life a lot easier, and more secure. When I made the first two posts (a test and “keyboardingIntoTheFuture”) in RStudio I was annoyed that even though I used the recommend functions <code>use_github</code> (I think) it wouldn’t rememeber my personal token for more than about half an hour and I would need to enter it again upon a push. With an SSH key this will never occur again. :) At least if you get your remote URL set correctly: it needs to be <code>ssh://git@github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY</code>, you cannot just change from <code>https</code> TO <code>ssh</code> if you have a remote configured already. Be sure to type <code>ssh://git@</code> when you’re prending and ensure the URL is then of the form just mentioned.</p>
<p>…this is why we always run <code>check_site()</code>!:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>● [TODO] Found 1 R Markdown file to update by re-rendering:

  content/post/2022-02-04-emacs-in/index.Rmd

<pre class="r"><code>build_site(build_rmd = &#39;timestamp&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>We do <em>not</em> need to knit ourselves, we can just build (the) site using blogdown and forget about it, specially so if there is no R code to evaluate (a simple Rmd to md conversion alone using knitr without any real knitting).</p>
