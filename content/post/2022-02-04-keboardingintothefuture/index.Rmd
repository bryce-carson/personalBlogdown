I like to use [`kmonad`](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad#-) to customize my keyboard. There's a lot of power in this Haskell application. I have several customizations:

```lisp
(defalias ᵺ–␛–⚿
  (tap-hold 200 esc caps))

(defalias ᵺ–|–%>%
(tap-hold 250 \\ (tap-macro % > %)))

(defalias ᵺ–,–<-
  (tap-hold 180 , (tap-macro < -)))
```

That won't make sense to you unless you have ever taken a look at KMonad's configuration langauge (it only *looks* like LISP), but it does three nice things.

- *Tapping* the <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> key sends <kbd>Esc</kbd>, while holding it for 200&nbsp;ms will toggle the Caps Lock state as it normally does.
- *Holding* <kbd>,<sup>< </sup></kbd> gives me an assignment <kbd><-</kbd> button.
- *Holding* <kbd>&#92;<sup>|</sup></kbd> gives me a magrittr::<kbd>%>%</kbd> button.

This is done with the `tap-hold` function, which takes three arguments: a time $t$, a button such as <kbd>,</kbd>, and another button.
